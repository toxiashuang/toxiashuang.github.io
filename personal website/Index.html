                        <h2>Leader. Thinker. Creator.</h2>
                        <p>Twenty years of living life to its fullest has molded Susan Huang into a bright and driven indidivdual. She is currently a sophomore studying Journalism at the University of Florida, but tracking for a career in the health field. As a result, her academics are an eclectic mix of hard sciences and creative thinking. She is just as excited about the Loop of Henle as she is about oxford commas.</p>
                        <p>Academics are only one piece of of the puzzle, however. Susan is passionate about service, people, and God. When she has time, she seeks out opportunities to engage in communities and experiences that are different from her own as an effort towards understanding. That understanding leads to a more effective way to meet individuals where they are and serve them right where they need it most.</p>
                        <p>Shifting paradigms and challenging opinions - both hers and others - brings Susan great excitement, but in her spare minutes she loves to read, write, and sing.</p>
