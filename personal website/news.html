                <h2>Writing: News</h2>
                <p>As a journalism student at the University of Florida, Susan has been trained in many different journalistic techniques including hard and soft news, AP style, press releases, and personality profiles. Below are some samples of her work, which were all written as assignments for a course at UF titled Multimedia Writing.</p>
                
           <div id="news">
               <ul>
                   <li><a href="files/sleep-story.pdf" target="_blank">Research Story</a><br />
                    "Study shows lasting effect of sleep loss" was written and researched as a completely independent effort by Susan.</li>
                   
                   <li><a href="files/food-story.pdf" target="_blank">Sustainability Story</a><br />
                    "University of Florida students and organizations reduce food waste" was written independently. Sources were independently contacted or provided by the course instructor.</li>
            
                    <li><a href="files/press-release.pdf" target="_blank">Press Release</a><br />
                    This press release was written with information provided by the instructor. The event was real, however, the press release was written after the event as practice.</li>
